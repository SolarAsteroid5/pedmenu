# PedMenu

<h3>A simple menu coded in LUA to change your ped model.</h3>

Be aware that this menu does not have every ped model and only the ones that I find most useful,
if you have any suggested ped models to add to the menu then please create a github suggestion or
open a ticket in my Discord server (https://discord.gg/4b2PVqEJ5c/).

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<br>
1. Download the latest release from GitHub.
<br>
2. Copy & paste the folder "pedmenu" to your FiveM resources folder.
<br>
3. Add the line "ensure pedmenu" to your server.cfg.
<br>
4. By default this menu opens with the F5 key.
<br>
<i>This menu requires NativeUI for FiveM to work, you can find this at https://github.com/FrazzIe/NativeUILua</i>
<br>
You may use this in a FiveM server without prior permission from the creator but we ask that you put comment
in the discussion or just let us know in the Discord server as this would be a great motivation to us.
<br>
This script is open-source and you are able to reproduce it yourself and edit it, if you do edit this then
we ask that you request permission before you release it as your own by opening a ticket in our discord
server.
